From the start, Tito got a kick out of infusing vodka for friends and quickly became known as “the vodka guy.” With a dream to do what he loved, and a dog by his side, he pursued a career in the spirits industry, risking it all until he sold his first case. \n\nOver twenty-five years later, Tito’s Handmade Vodka has stayed true to its roots and is designed to be savored by both spirit connoisseurs and those who enjoy a simple cocktail. Our gluten-free, low-calorie* vodka is American-made, unflavored, and distilled using old-fashioned copper pot stills, inspired by the distillation methods of fine single malt scotches and high-end French cognacs. Over 25 years later, the process remains the same; Tito’s is made in batches, with each batch taste-tested, and goes down smooth with an impeccably clean finish. From a Bloody Mary at brunch, a martini at cocktail hour, or a simple Tito’s and soda with friends – just add Tito’s and enjoy! Distilled and bottled on the same land in Austin, Texas, Tito’s Handmade Vodka is made from 100% corn and is naturally gluten-free. Available in Liter, 1.75L, 750mL, 375mL, 200mL, and 50mL sizes. \n\n*(Average Analysis per 1.5oz Tito’s Handmade Vodka: 98 calories, Carbohydrates 0 grams, Protein 0 grams, Fat 0 grams)","Address":"7066 Hwy 70 S, Nashville, TN 37221, USA","PhoneNumber":"+16156461400","price":19.99,"priceCurrency":"USD","ratingValue":4.4,"Content":"40% ABV","Type":"Spirits","Subtype":"Gluten Free ,Kosher ,","Vodka":"Country","United_States":"State","Texas":"Region"},{"name":"Bacardi Superior Light Rum","url":"https://shopredspirits.com/shop?product-id=61377c508effb63f2ea54fc8&option-id=1fe13179171357eb86e1c48a16848ae0662ffb6b291b1500262526847ef4f20b","image":"https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/628ea1e82b28c327299635a8/large.png","description":"BACARDÍ Superior Rum is a light and aromatically balanced rum.
